/*
PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Given vacation_plans tables shows the vacations applied by each employee during the year 2024. 
Leave_balance table has the available leaves for each employee.
Write an SQL query to determine if the vacations applied by each employee can be approved or not based on the available leave balance. 
If an employee has enough available leaves then mention the status as "Approved" else mention "Insufficient Leave Balance".
Assume there are no public holidays during 2024. weekends (sat & sun) should be excluded while calculating vacation days.
